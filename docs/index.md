# Problem Details for HTTP APIs

This registry acts as a well-known location for problem detail types returned by various APIs. It acts as a central registry to promote reuse and clarity of problem detail types conforming to [RFC 9457](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9457), formerly [RFC 7807](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7807).

## Problem Types

| Problem type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| [Already Exists](already-exists.md) | The request attempted to create a resource that already exists. |
| [Business Rule Violation](business-rule-violation.md) | The request is deemed invalid as it failed business rule checks. |
| [Invalid Body Property Format](invalid-body-property-format.md) | One or more of the body properties was malformed. |
| [Invalid Body Property Value](invalid-body-property-value.md) | One or more of the body property values are invalid. |
| [Invalid Request Header Format](invalid-request-header-format.md) | One or more of the request headers was malformed. |
| [Invalid Request Parameter Format](invalid-request-parameter-format.md) | One or more of the query or path parameters was malformed. |
| [Invalid Request Parameter Value](invalid-request-parameter-value.md) | One or more of the query or path parameter values are invalid. |
| [Invalid State Transition](invalid-state-transition.md) | The requested transition is not valid for the current item status. |
| [Missing Body Property](missing-body-property.md) | The request is missing an expected body property. |
| [Missing Request Header](missing-request-header.md) | The request lacked an expected header. |
| [Missing Request Parameter](missing-request-parameter.md) | The request is missing a query or path parameter. |
| [License Cancelled](license-cancelled.md) | The client license has been cancelled, rendering the service unavailable. |
| [License Expired](license-expired.md) | The client license has expired, rendering the service unavailable. |
| [Validation Error](validation-error.md) | The request is invalid and deemed unprocessable. |

## Common Problem Types

The following types can also be leveraged for convenience; however, the recommendation is to utilize the [IANA registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-problem-types/http-problem-types.xhtml) for generic/common types.

| Problem type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| [Bad Request](bad-request.md) | The client request is invalid or malformed. |
| [Conflict](conflict.md) | The request conflicts with the current state of the target resource. |
| [Failed Dependency](failed-dependency.md) | The requested action depends on another action that failed. |
| [Forbidden](forbidden.md) | The request is not authorized for the resource. |
| [Gone](gone.md) | The requested resource is no longer available and the condition is likely permanent. |
| [Insufficient Storage](insufficient-storage.md) | The server lacks enough storage to complete the requested action. |
| [Invalid Parameters](invalid-parameters.md) | One or more of the parameters was malformed. |
| [Method Not Allowed](method-not-allowed.md) | The target resource does not support the request method. |
| [Not Acceptable](not-acceptable.md) | No representation matches the request's content negotiation preferences. |
| [Not Found](not-found.md) | The requested resource could not be found. |
| [Not Implemented](not-implemented.md) | The server does not support the functionality required by the request. |
| [Request Timeout](request-timeout.md) | The server timed out while waiting to receive the request. |
| [Server Error](server-error.md) | The server encountered an unexpected error. |
| [Service Unavailable](service-unavailable.md) | The requested service is currently unavailable. |
| [Unauthorized](unauthorized.md) | The client request missed or malformed its credentials. |
| [Unavailable For Legal Reasons](unavailable-for-legal-reasons.md) | The requested resource is unavailable because of a legal restriction. |
| [Unprocessable Content](unprocessable-content.md) | The request is syntactically correct but cannot be processed. |

When necessary, a Problem Detail response *MAY* include additional detail on the problems that have occurred. The additional errors **MUST** be under the `errors` collection, which itself follows the JSON Schema defined in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/eoap/problems-registry).

## Python Usage

Install the package in an environment with Pydantic 2:

```bash
pip install http-apis-problems-detail
```

Use the generated models to build responses with fixed registry fields and optional extension members:

```python
import http_apis_problems_detail as registry

problem = registry.MissingRequestParameter(
    instance="https://api.example.test/problems/abc123",
    code="400-03",
    errors=[
        registry.ErrorDetail(
            detail="The query parameter limit is required.",
            parameter="limit",
        )
    ],
)

payload = problem.model_dump(mode="json", exclude_none=True)
```

The resulting payload includes the registered `type`, `status`, `title`, and `detail` values:

```json
{
  "instance": "https://api.example.test/problems/abc123",
  "code": "400-03",
  "errors": [
    {
      "detail": "The query parameter limit is required.",
      "parameter": "limit"
    }
  ],
  "type": "https://terradue.github.io/http-apis-problems-detail/missing-request-parameter",
  "status": 400,
  "title": "Missing request parameter",
  "detail": "The request is missing an expected query or path parameter.",
}
```

`ProblemDetails` and `ErrorDetail` allow additional provider-specific fields, while generated problem classes use Pydantic literal fields to protect the registered `type`, `status`, `title`, and `detail` values.

### FastAPI Integration

The [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) integration requires Python 3.10 or newer. FastAPI is included as a package dependency:

```bash
pip install http-apis-problems-detail
```

Register an exception handler that returns the problem detail as the response body, then raise a `ProblemRegistryException` subclass from a route:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, status as http_status

from http_apis_problems_detail import 
from http_apis_problems_detail.fastapi import (
    PROBLEM_RESPONSES,
    ProblemRegistryException,
    NotFoundException,
    problem_registry_exception_handler,
)

app = FastAPI()
app.add_exception_handler(ProblemRegistryException, problem_registry_exception_handler)

@app.get(
    "/resources/{resource_id}",
    responses={
        http_status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND: PROBLEM_RESPONSES[http_status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND]
    },
)
async def get_resource(resource_id: str, request: Request) -> dict[str, str]:
    raise NotFoundException(
        request=request,
        errors=ErrorDetail(parameter="resource_id", detail=f"Resource '{resource_id}' was not found.")
    )
```

The example works as follows:

1. **Import the integration helpers.** `PROBLEM_RESPONSES` maps HTTP status codes to response model definitions that FastAPI can include in its OpenAPI document. `NotFoundException` represents the registered Not Found problem, while `ProblemRegistryException` is the common base class for the registry exceptions.
2. **Register the exception handler.** `app.add_exception_handler(...)` installs `problem_registry_exception_handler` for the base exception and its subclasses. The handler sends the serialized problem directly as the response body, using the problem's HTTP status and the `application/problem+json` content type.
3. **Document the route's error response.** The `responses` argument selects the HTTP 404 entry from `PROBLEM_RESPONSES`, so FastAPI documents the `NotFound` model for this route. This declaration describes the response in OpenAPI; raising the exception produces the response at runtime. For status codes shared by multiple problem types, the mapping contains a union of those models.
4. **Use the incoming request to identify the occurrence.** FastAPI supplies `resource_id` from the path and injects the current `Request`. Passing `request=request` lets the exception set the problem's `instance` to the request URL, with the query string removed.
5. **Raise the registered problem.** `NotFoundException` supplies the registered `type`, `status`, `title`, and `detail` fields. This minimal example always raises HTTP 404; in an application, raise it when the resource lookup fails and return the resource when it succeeds.

To document every registered problem response on a route, pass `responses=PROBLEM_RESPONSES`. Select individual status entries, as above, when only those responses apply.
